# Flow Autopilot

Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that chains 3 manual copy-paste steps into
one click:

1. **ChatGPT (plain chat)** — analyzes a product photo, returns product
   details + a storyboard-image prompt + a video prompt.
2. **ChatGPT image generation** — turns the storyboard prompt (+ the same
   product photo) into a storyboard image.
3. **Google Flow (Veo)** — turns the storyboard image + video prompt into
   an AI video clip.

Inspired by the manual workflow shown in [this YouTube Short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ONcS93wLmPQ).

## Design goals

- **100% client-side.** No server, no backend, no shared credentials.
  Every user runs this in their own Chrome, using their own already
  logged-in ChatGPT and Google sessions.
- **Not a personal script.** Built so anyone can install it and run their
  own pipeline — no per-user setup required (see "v2: no custom GPT"
  below).
- **No silent failures.** Every DOM step that can't find what it's
  looking for throws a specific, visible error (which selector, which
  step, what to do about it) instead of hanging or doing nothing.

## Install (unpacked, for now)

1. `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode**.
2. **Load unpacked** → select this repo's root folder (the one with
   `manifest.json`).
3. Open the popup, choose a product photo, click **Run**. That's it — no
   configuration needed before first use.

## v2: no custom GPT

The original design (v1) used a ChatGPT **custom GPT** for step 1, with
its system prompt doing the product analysis. That broke on real-world
testing: free ChatGPT accounts can't create custom GPTs at all (GPT
Builder needs Plus/Pro/Team/Enterprise — confirmed via OpenAI's own help
docs), and OpenAI has signaled custom GPTs may eventually be superseded
by Plugins. Depending on step 1 having a custom GPT set up was fragile
both short-term (doesn't work on free tier) and long-term (feature may go
away).

v2 drops the custom GPT entirely: step 1 opens a plain `chatgpt.com` new
chat and sends the same analysis instructions as a regular message
(`FA_ANALYZE_TEMPLATE` in `src/lib/messages.js`), attached together with
the product photo in one message. This works on any ChatGPT account,
free included, with zero setup. The exact wording is fixed by spec (see
that file's comment for provenance) — verified byte-for-byte identical to
the spec's fenced template block before commit. It's editable in
**Options** if you want to adjust tone/style, but the shipped default
must stay exact.

## Architecture

```
popup (UI)  <--chrome.storage.local (faRun)-->  background.js (orchestrator)
                                                        |  chrome.tabs.sendMessage
                                                        v
                                    content-chatgpt.js / content-flow.js
                                       (DOM automation, per open tab)
```

- **`src/background/background.js`** — the only writer of pipeline state
  (`chrome.storage.local['faRun']`). Opens each step's tab, sends it a
  "run this step" message, and reacts to the step's completion message.
  Never touches page DOM directly.
- **`src/content/content-chatgpt.js`** — runs on `chatgpt.com`. Handles
  both the analyze step and the image-gen step, both on a plain new chat
  (no custom GPT — see "v2" above), driven by the `mode` field in the
  message it receives.
- **`src/content/content-flow.js`** — runs on `flow.google.com` (Google
  Flow's app now lives there — see "Domain history" below). Uploads the
  storyboard image, submits the video prompt, waits for Veo, extracts the
  result.
- **`src/lib/selectors.js`** — the single file to edit when a site's DOM
  changes and a step starts throwing "selector not found". Each element
  has a list of candidate selectors tried in order, most specific first,
  broadest structural fallback last.
- **`src/lib/dom-utils.js`** — shared helpers: `waitFor()` (poll with a
  descriptive timeout error), file-input attachment via `DataTransfer`,
  React-safe value setting, contenteditable typing, generation-complete
  polling, `findByVisibleText()` (matches an element by its rendered text
  instead of a structural guess), and `isLastResortMatch()` (flags when a
  `waitFor()` call only matched because of the broadest fallback
  candidate — see "Selector specificity" below).
- **`src/popup/`**, **`src/options/`** — UI. The popup is a pure renderer
  of `faRun` state (`idle` / `running` / `awaiting_review` / `error` /
  `done`); it never contains pipeline logic itself. Options only holds
  the editable analyze template and the auto-review toggle — no required
  fields, since v2 needs no setup.

### Domain history

Google Flow moved from `labs.google/fx/tools/flow` to `flow.google.com`.
Confirmed directly (not by trusting a search result) on 2026-09-13:
`curl -sI https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow` returns an HTTP 308 redirect
to `https://flow.google.com/`, and every `/shared/tool/<id>` sub-path
308s the same way — it's a full migration, not a partial one, even though
Google's own `/about` marketing page still links a few "Tools" cards to
the old `labs.google` URLs (the server-side redirect covers it either
way). `manifest.json`'s `host_permissions` and `content_scripts.matches`
target `flow.google.com` accordingly. A login-redirect probe
(`accounts.google.com/...&continue=https://flow.google.com/`) further
confirmed the authenticated app itself resolves back to `flow.google.com`
after sign-in, not some other subdomain.

### Selector specificity

A selector list matching *something* isn't the same as matching the
*right* something — `input[type="file"]` as a first-choice candidate can
silently grab the wrong file input on a page with more than one, without
ever throwing. Two mitigations, not just reordering:

1. Structural guesses that were too broad to trust as primary candidates
   (e.g. `button[type="submit"]` for Flow's Generate button) were removed
   or pushed to last resort. Where a purely structural fallback would
   otherwise be needed, `findByVisibleText()` matches on the button's
   actual rendered text (e.g. "Generate") instead — more specific than a
   tag/attribute guess, since it's checking what a human would read.
2. `waitFor()` tags the element it found with which candidate matched.
   If only the broadest, last-resort candidate matched, the content
   script attaches a visible warning to that step's result instead of
   proceeding silently — surfaced in the popup as a yellow banner
   (`faRun.warnings`) so a risky match is something the user actually
   sees, not a thing hidden behind a `true` return value.

### Review checkpoints (default on)

Between step 1→2 and 2→3, the popup pauses and shows the extracted
prompts (and the generated storyboard image) for the user to confirm or
edit before continuing. This is a deliberate choice, not just a spec
requirement: the analyze step's 3-way text split
(`parseAnalysisResponse` in `content-chatgpt.js`) is now higher-confidence
than v1 — it matches the exact headings `FA_ANALYZE_TEMPLATE` asks for
("1. Product Description" etc.) first, with the older looser heuristics
kept as a fallback — but it's still parsing a model's free-text reply,
not a guaranteed structured output. Turn review off in
**Options → "หยุดให้ตรวจสอบผลลัพธ์ระหว่างแต่ละขั้น"** for a fully unattended
run once you trust the split.

## Known limitations / what has NOT been verified

This extension was scaffolded and written without an authenticated
ChatGPT + Google Flow session available in the build environment, so:

- **DOM selectors in `src/lib/selectors.js` are a first draft**, based on
  public inspection of ChatGPT/Flow markup, not exercised against a real
  logged-in session (no such session is available in this build
  environment) — Google Flow's editor UI (upload input, prompt field,
  Generate button) sits behind a Google login wall that couldn't be
  crossed here. They are very likely to need adjustment — that's exactly
  why they live in one file with multiple fallback candidates each, why
  the most generic candidate is deliberately last instead of first, and
  why matching only that last-resort candidate now surfaces a visible
  warning in the popup instead of proceeding silently (see "Selector
  specificity" above). ChatGPT's plain-chat composer/file-input/send
  selectors are lower-risk than Flow's, since a plain new chat is the
  most standard, commonly-scraped ChatGPT surface — but still unverified
  against a live logged-in session.
- **The Google Flow domain** (`flow.google.com`) was confirmed directly
  via `curl -I`, not by trusting a web search result — see "Domain
  history" above. An earlier version of this extension targeted the old
  `labs.google/fx/tools/flow` domain based on a search result alone; that
  was wrong (the domain had migrated) and was caught in review before any
  end-to-end use.
- **What *was* verified**: `manifest.json` loads cleanly and its actual
  background service worker executes (confirmed via Chrome DevTools
  Protocol against the running extension's real ID — see below), all JS
  files have valid syntax, and popup/options render without console
  errors. Content-script injection was checked on both live target
  domains (`chatgpt.com`, `flow.google.com`) with no script errors.
  `FA_ANALYZE_TEMPLATE` was diffed programmatically against the spec's
  fenced template block and confirmed byte-for-byte identical.

If you hit a "selector not found" error when actually running this
against real ChatGPT/Flow pages: open dev tools on that tab, inspect the
element in question, and update the matching entry in
`src/lib/selectors.js`.

## Testing done so far

- `node --check` on every `.js` file (syntax validity).
- `manifest.json` schema sanity (valid JSON, required MV3 fields present).
- Loaded unpacked and verified the actual background service worker
  executes via Chrome DevTools Protocol against its real extension ID
  (`chrome.runtime.getManifest().name`, `host_permissions`/`permissions`,
  listener registration all checked directly against the live worker, not
  inferred from log absence). **Caveat that caught a real bug**:
  `google-chrome-stable` silently ignores `--load-extension` as of
  Chrome 137+ (a branded-Chrome restriction) — an early smoke test looked
  clean (exit 0, no console errors) purely because the extension had
  never actually loaded. Cross-checked against `chrome://extensions`
  internal state and switched to a Chrome for Testing build, where the
  flag genuinely works, to get a real result.
- Content scripts confirmed to inject without console errors on both
  live target domains: `chatgpt.com` and `flow.google.com`. Went one step
  further than "no errors" — confirmed via CDP that a named "Flow
  Autopilot" isolated execution context is actually created on both
  domains (the same technique used to originally catch the domain bug:
  before the fix, that context existed on `chatgpt.com` but not on the
  (then-wrong) Flow domain).
- Domain migration verified with `curl -I` against the live redirect
  (`labs.google/fx/tools/flow` → 308 → `flow.google.com`), not by
  re-trusting the earlier web-search result that had gone stale.
- `FA_ANALYZE_TEMPLATE` diffed programmatically (Python) against the
  spec's fenced code block — confirmed byte-for-byte identical, not just
  visually similar.
- **Not yet tested**: an actual end-to-end run against logged-in
  ChatGPT + Google Flow accounts (no such session is available in this
  environment — Flow's editor UI is behind a Google login wall). Please
  test with your own account per the original task — if a selector is
  wrong, it'll surface as a clear labeled error or a visible "last-resort
  match" warning, not a hang or a silent wrong action.

## Risks (shown to the user in-app too)

- Automating ChatGPT/Google Flow's UI may violate each platform's Terms
  of Service. Each user runs this with their own account, so the risk is
  theirs individually — this is not "safe" in any absolute sense, and the
  extension does not claim otherwise anywhere.
- Realistic delays are inserted between actions (roughly human-paced, not
  instant) to avoid firing faster than a person plausibly would, but this
  is a mitigation, not a guarantee against detection or account action.

## Out of scope (v1)

- No backend/server.
- No payment/subscription.
- No headless or multi-account parallel runs.
- No auto-publishing the resulting video anywhere else — the pipeline
  ends once Google Flow has produced the clip.
